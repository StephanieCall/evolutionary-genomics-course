## What I do

![I enjoy rowing and racing in a single scull on the Connecticut River in Northampton. I've medalled in a few races since I started rowing at the Northampton Community Rowing Club](images/Rowing.JPG)
 
![In my research, I am using CRIPSR interference to repress genes in bacteria to determine which are associated with cell attachment and biofilm formation](images/dCas9Binding.png)
